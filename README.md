# Obsidian Weekly Notes
A stand-alone plugin for creating weekly notes. Inspired by [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) but without the need for the [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin#weekly-notes-have-a-new-home) plugin.

## Features
- Set the starting weekday
- Select a template file to use for the weekly note
- Handles [template variables](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/templates#Template+variables) and respects settings from the core [Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/templates) plugin
- Set title format using [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) syntax

## Commands
### Create weekly note
Create a new weekly note and open it, or if the file already exists just open it.
